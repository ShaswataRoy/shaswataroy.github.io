      <p>I'm a postoc at Yale's Biomedical Engineering department. My research examines stochastic processes in biological systems, particularly cellular growth dynamics and gene regulatory networks.
      Living systems are often out of equilibrium due to variability in biomolecular reactions.
      I focus on designing mechanistic models that help understand the biochemical origins of population heterogeneities. This often involves looking single cell -omics data from a probabilistic lens and then using approaches derived from statistical mechanics and machine learning to study various emergent phenomenon.</p>
      <p>I recently completed my PhD in Physics from Purdue University. My thesis is entitled <em>"Stochasticity-induced heterogeneity in cellular processes"</em>. Prior to Purdue, I studied physics at IIT Madras, focusing primarily on active matter research. In particular, I was studying pattern formation in a binary mixture of active and passive rods.</p>
      <p>When I'm not in the lab, you'll find me playing piano or at the gym.</p>
